TODO: Detailed explanation of every feature

syntax on

	Syntax highlighting enables Vim to show parts of the text in another font
	or color. Those parts can be specific keywords or text matching a pattern.

	Syntax highlighting is not available when the |+syntax| feature has been
	disabled at compile time.

set bg=dark

	sets the Backgorund base color to be dark. Colorschemes work on top of
	this color.

colorscheme gruvbox

	Vim reads files from the output of command: "set runtimepath" in that
	order.
	I've downloaded "gruvbox" colorscheme and have placed it in:
		usr/local/share/vim/vim90/colors/gruvbox.vim

	*NOTE*
	When a version of Vim gets updated, you have to put this file in
	correct folder.

	For example if Current version:
		VIM - Vi Improved 9.0 (2022 Jun 28, compiled Sep 6 2022 16:16:10)

	cheanges into, say:
		VIM - Vi Improved 9.3(2023 Feb 12, compiled at Feb 15 2023 1:11:11)

	Then you have to put the file "gruvbox" into:
		usr/local/share/vim/vim93/colors/gruvbox.vim
	instead of the previous:
		usr/local/share/vim/vim90/colors/gruvbox.vim
